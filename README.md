# Workbook-Assignment-8-pg-86

The purpose of assignment 8 was to create a pie chart utilizing data created and placed in columns. Furthmore, to complete the assigment I needed to properly import pandas and matplotlib. Moroever, I was able to create an additonal column once I confirmed the dataframe was properly created. I  needed to have the pie chart rotate and output the worst performing student, instead of the initial high performing student.
